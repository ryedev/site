              <div class="small-12 medium-6 column">
                <p>Cowboy Ventures is an amazing team of business minds located in the Bay Area that invests in rising companies. These companies are led by founders who are building products that re-imagine work and personal life; companies such as <a href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" target="_blank"><span>Dollar Shave Club</span></a>, <a href="http://august.com/" target="_blank"><span>August</span></a>, <a href="https://www.styleseat.com/" target="_blank"><span>StyleSeat</span></a>, <a href="https://www.rise.us/" target="_blank"><span>Rise</span></a>, and the <a href="http://cowboy.vc/companies.html" target="_blank"><span>list</span></a> goes on.  </p>
                <p>Cowboy approached us wanting to polish up their existing site and implement a blog page to keep followers current when articles such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/what-studying-students-teaches-us-about-great-apps/?ncid=facebook_social_share" target=_blank""><span>this</span></a> go live on TechCrunch.</p>

                <p>The solution was to implement a clean and simple Wordpress blog that the Cowboy VC team can curate that blends with the rest of the site design. Adding some nice UX touches throughout the site that complement not only the Cowboy VC brand, but also their portfolio companies, was crucial.</p>

                <p>In an industry that is constantly changing, we wanted to create a build that can hold up to the ever-evoloving landscape of the tech and venture world. A lot of care went into this project under-the-hood cleaning up and updating some of the existing code base to lay a solid foundation for future growth.</p>

                  <p>A strong web presence in the form of an enjoyable user experience goes a long way. Adding some TLC to a site returns lengthier site visits, higher click-through rates, and ultimately raises the bottom line. When keeping in touch with your network and followers is important to you, a blog is a great way to get your voice out. </p>

                <p>We started with conversations about the history of the company and their vision for the future. With a website and logo created many years ago, it was time for a refresh to reflect the redefined NAV.VC identity with a focus on what sets them apart: the founders they invest in. </p>
                <p>With that in mind, we made sure to spotlight their founders throughout the site, as evident on the home page.</p>

                <p>Having a rapidly growing and changing portfolio, NAV.VC would be best served by having access to a CMS to keep things current. Whether it be a company having a successful exit or a new adition to the NAV.VC family, they can rest assured that those updates are reflected immediately.</p>

They relentlessly work around the clock to support the companies they believe in; that inspired us to do the same for them. It was a pleasure working with them, as we know the founders they work with share our sentiments.</p>
