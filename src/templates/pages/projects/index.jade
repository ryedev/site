          h5 Seed fund based in San Francisco, CA
        .small-12.medium-6.column
          p Cowboy Ventures is an amazing team of business minds located in the Bay Area that invests in rising companies. These companies are led by founders who are building products that re-imagine work and personal life; companies such as <a href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" target="_blank"><span>Dollar Shave Club</span></a>, <a href="http://august.com/" target="_blank"><span>August</span></a>, <a href="https://www.styleseat.com/" target="_blank"><span>StyleSeat</span></a>, <a href="https://www.rise.us/" target="_blank"><span>Rise</span></a>, and the <a href="http://cowboy.vc/companies.html" target="_blank"><span>list</span></a> goes on.  
          p Cowboy approached us wanting to polish up their existing site and implement a blog page to keep followers current when articles such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/what-studying-students-teaches-us-about-great-apps/?ncid=facebook_social_share" target=_blank""><span>this</span></a> go live on TechCrunch.

          p The solution was to implement a clean and simple Wordpress blog that the Cowboy VC team can curate that blends with the rest of the site design. Adding some nice UX touches throughout the site that complement not only the Cowboy VC brand, but also their portfolio companies, was crucial.

          p In an industry that is constantly changing, we wanted to create a build that can hold up to the ever-evoloving landscape of the tech and venture world. A lot of care went into this project under-the-hood cleaning up and updating some of the existing code base to lay a solid foundation for future growth.

            p A strong web presence in the form of an enjoyable user experience goes a long way. Adding some TLC to a site returns lengthier site visits, higher click-through rates, and ultimately raises the bottom line. When keeping in touch with your network and followers is important to you, a blog is a great way to get your voice out.

        .small-12.medium-6.column
          p In a city that moves as fast as San Francisco, with 20,000 new residents entering the city between 2010 and 2012 and 26,700 new jobs added last year, the demand for real estate is high.
          p The folks over at <a href="http://smartrises.com/" target="_blank"><span>San Francisco Rises</span></a> wanted to solve the challenge of connecting people in search of high-rise residential properties with real estate in the area.

          p When new buildings enter construction they will be posted to the app where users can find them easily, see what others are saying, and post updates and images as the buildings near completion.
        .small-12.medium-6.column
          p Knowing that a large percentage of new residents are in the tech industry, we designed the app to be easily navigable, clean and accessible across all devices.

          h5 The Interactive Project Initiator
        .small-12.medium-6.column
          p The process of scoping and signing a project can be arduous. A lot is on the line between you and your client, and the terms defined here can result in success or failure.
          p TIPI was conceived to address this important area of project management by giving users a single tool for defining the scope of work and templating documents including proposals, contracts and briefs.

          p A stakeholder fills out a questionnaire and saves it to the database, creating a project planner. Next, users can review and edit the planner based on conversation with the client. Total cost and deposit are automatically calculated.
        .small-12.medium-6.column
          p Once published, a planner is injected in to a templatized proposal for signature and agreement, a legally binding contract, and a brief for project teams to kick off work.

          p TIPI was built on the ember.js framework and connected to the firebase SDK. This setup provides two-way data binding, allowing users to work remotely with their clients and provide real-time updates to their project planner.

            h5.text-left Next Steps
            p TIPI is still in the initiation phase itself. We have big plans for growing the app and the business around it. Already, it has been met with enthusiasm in closed groups. More to come!

          h5 Website and gated application
        .small-12.medium-6.column
          p The Home Owners Association of Waterford in Clemmons, NC not only needed a brochure style website, they also needed a password protected application for connecting the community.
          p Our team created just that. On the surface it looks a lot like any other HOA website, with information about the area, the local government, schools, shopping and the like, but behind all of that lies a gated application for home owners to share ideas and events.
